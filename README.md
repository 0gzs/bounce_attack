## Conception

Bounce Attack was built during my time at Coding Dojo, as one of three of my final projects.

## How To Play

The game begins with two ninja heads falling from the sky, and the player must bounce each ninja out to the side. 

There's just one problem, knocking out one small ninja head produces two larger heads, and one larger head produces two smaller ones. 

The goal? Crash the game!
